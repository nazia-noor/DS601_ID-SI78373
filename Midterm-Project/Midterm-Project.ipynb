    "1. What is the overall success and failure rate of the campaign? \n",
    "2. Did the number of the call made to each customer affect their decision to invest in a term deposit?\n",
    "3. Did call duration influence customers' decisions? \n",
    "4. Did clients' current balance have any influence over their decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the analysis is based on a hypothesis. I hypothesize that most of the clients who have subscribed \"Term Deposit\" campaign are those who were successful clients in their last campaign. Because loyal customers tend to take different offers or services from their preferred organization. However, I will test the data available to see if that hypothesis is true and what other results I can interpret from this. \n",
