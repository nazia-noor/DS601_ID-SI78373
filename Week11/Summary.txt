When a search engine determines that a user is interested in a particular subject, it can provide the user with more targeted results. The topic-sensitive PageRank method generates each vector for each of a small number of subjects, rather than a large vector to make storing simpler, influencing the PageRank to support certain pages. On the other hand, the disadvantage is it loses some accuracy.
Assume there are some pages that reflect a particular subject, such as "sports." We may arrange for random surfers to be added only to a random sports page to create a topic-sensitive PageRank for sports. As a result of this decision, random surfers are more likely to land on a sports page. The pages they connect to are likely to be about sports as well, but the likelihood of them being about sports decreases as the gap between a known sports page increase.
