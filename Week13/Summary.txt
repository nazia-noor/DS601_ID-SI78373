The Bitcoin system's integrity is maintained by the hardware, which has progressed from CPUs to GPUs to FPGAs to application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The most recent generation of Bitcoin hardware is ASICs. The changes happened very quickly. In September 2010, the first publicly available CUDA-based GPU miner was released, followed by the first OpenCL miner a month later. Pooled mining appeared shortly after, in November 2010. June 2011, developers published the first open source FPGA miner code. The first ASIC miner was released in January, followed by more advanced ASICs by mid-2015.
The Bitcoin system uses a consensus algorithm that runs on hardware all over the world to keep a global, distributed cryptographic blockchain. Mining, a computationally intensive proof-of-work function that incorporates BTC transactions into the blockchain, is performed by these devices. Each transaction is combined with other pending transactions into a block and posted to the blockchain's head by a single computer. A hash of the previous head block is also included in each block, resulting in a complete order. Other nodes in the system can check that the transaction is in order and then use the new block as the head block for potential blockchain updates. Bitcoin mining is the main part of the distributed consensus algorithm that ensures BTC transactions are consistent. Bitcoin mining has consolidated over time.
